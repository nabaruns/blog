Example Markdown Post . . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a &quot;level 1 heading&quot; in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here&#39;s a footnote [^1]. Here&#39;s a horizontal rule: . . . Lists . Here&#39;s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | . Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes . ...and... . . You can include info boxes . .

Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .
